Since the whole world devided into continents and the script is only for one continent 
thus needs some changes with respect to each continent, the changes are as follows:

1. changing the link of the desired continent boundary that is available from asset.
2. changing the value of 'y' in for loop that is refering to the number of hexagons.
3. changing the value of 'numPoints' in stratified sampling.

*** For both 2 and 3, it is possible to put any number needed but to avoid encountering errors 
such as 'Computation timed out', speeding ​​up processing and to make balance between the number of 
burned and unburned points, specific values used for each continent that can be find in the document.
